Lo! Behold the tale of Atharv Dwivedi, a learned scholar in the noble field of Computer Science and Engineering, whose journey shines bright as the stars themselves. Within his portfolio, one shall discover the marvels of his craft, where projects abound—chief amongst them being a device most wondrous, forged through the cunning art of temperature detection. With the aid of Arduino, thermistors, and the alchemy of system design, he doth breathe life into technology that senses the warmth of the very air itself.

In this, Atharv doth skillfully unite the realms of hardware and software, weaving them together as a master weaves his loom, creating harmony between code and circuit. His passion, like a roaring tempest, is for the creation of solutions that walk not only in the world of thought but stride boldly into the realm of reality.
